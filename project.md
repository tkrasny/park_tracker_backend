# National Parks Tracker - Project Overview

## Project Summary
A personal web application to visually track and showcase national parks visited and hikes completed. The project is primarily focused on creating a visually impressive frontend for portfolio/interview purposes while improving React skills.

## Technology Stack
- **Frontend**: React with TypeScript
- **Backend**: NestJS
- **Database**: PostgreSQL (AWS RDS)
- **Authentication**: Auth0
- **Development Approach**: Using Cursor AI for code implementation, with external AI assistance for project planning
- **Styling**: 
  - Material-UI (MUI) for base components and layout structure
  - styled-components for custom components and unique styling needs
  - Google Fonts (Outfit) for modern typography
- **Map Library**: Mapbox GL JS (implemented)
- **Deployment**: GitHub Pages (frontend), AWS (backend)

## Current Progress
### Completed Features
1. **Interactive Map Interface** (Priority 1)
   - âœ… Mapbox GL JS integration
   - âœ… Custom map controls (zoom, style switcher)
   - âœ… Park markers with hover interactions
   - âœ… Modern, clean UI with glass-morphism effects
   - âœ… Responsive layout with overlay navigation
   - âœ… Satellite map view as default
   - âœ… Custom marker styling and popups
   - âœ… Basic park data integration
   - âœ… Parks List view implementation
   - âœ… GitHub Pages deployment

2. **UI/UX Improvements**
   - âœ… Modern navigation system with overlay design
   - âœ… Clean typography using Outfit font
   - âœ… Responsive design considerations
   - âœ… Smooth transitions and hover effects
   - âœ… Consistent styling across components

### In Progress
1. **Authentication & User Management**
   - ðŸ”„ Auth0 integration
   - ðŸ”„ User profile management
   - ðŸ”„ Protected routes
   - ðŸ”„ User session handling

2. **Backend Infrastructure**
   - ðŸ”„ AWS RDS PostgreSQL setup
   - ðŸ”„ Database schema design
   - ðŸ”„ API endpoints for park visit tracking
   - ðŸ”„ User data persistence

3. **Map Features**
   - ðŸ”„ Visit status tracking
   - ðŸ”„ Custom marker states for visited/unvisited parks
   - ðŸ”„ Interactive visit marking from map view

## Next Steps
1. **Authentication Setup**
   - Set up Auth0 account and configuration
   - Implement Auth0 provider in frontend
   - Add login/logout functionality
   - Create protected routes
   - Add user profile icon and dropdown

2. **Database Implementation**
   - Set up AWS RDS PostgreSQL instance
   - Design and implement database schema
   - Create user and park visit tables
   - Set up database migrations
   - Implement data access layer

3. **Backend Development**
   - Set up NestJS project structure
   - Implement user authentication middleware
   - Create park visit tracking endpoints
   - Add data validation and error handling
   - Set up CORS and security configurations

4. **Frontend Enhancements**
   - Add user profile UI components
   - Implement visit marking functionality
   - Add visit status indicators on map
   - Add visit history tracking

## Technical Debt & Improvements
- Add loading states for map operations
- Implement error boundaries
- Add unit tests for components
- Optimize map performance
- Add API error handling
- Implement request caching
- Set up monitoring and logging

## Development Notes
### Map Implementation Details
- Using Mapbox GL JS for advanced mapping features
- Custom marker system with hover interactions
- Disabled free zooming for better UX
- Implemented zoom-to-park on marker click
- Satellite view as default map style
- Custom controls for zoom and map style switching

### UI Design Decisions
- Overlay navigation system for clean map view
- Glass-morphism effects for modern look
- Outfit font for clean typography
- Responsive design with mobile considerations
- Subtle animations and transitions
- Consistent color scheme and styling

### Known Issues & Considerations
- Map performance optimization needed for large datasets
- Need to implement proper loading states
- Consider adding map clustering for dense areas
- May need to implement custom map style for better branding
- Need to handle authentication state persistence

## Development Environment
- Node.js and npm for package management
- Vite for development and building
- ESLint and Prettier for code quality
- Git for version control
- AWS CLI for cloud management
- Docker for local development

## Project Goals
1. Improve React/TypeScript skills through practical application
2. Create a visually impressive project for technical interviews
3. Build a useful tool for personal use to track national park visits
4. Implement best practices for frontend development
5. Gain experience with cloud infrastructure
6. Implement secure authentication and data persistence

## Deployment
- Frontend: GitHub Pages (implemented)
- Backend: AWS (planned)
- Database: AWS RDS (planned)
- Authentication: Auth0 (planned)
